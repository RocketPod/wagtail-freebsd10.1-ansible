Wagtail CMS FreeBSD 10.1 Ansible playbook
=========================================

A simple playbook for deploying a `Wagtail <http://wagtail.io/>`
development environment on FreeBSD 10.1.

We have tried to be as minimalist as possible and presume that the vagrant box
you are using is already somewhat well configured. As such there may be gaps
in the dependencies.

Goal
~~~~
We would ideally like to see this work centralised into a repository of Ansible
playbooks for deploying wagtail to a variety of development environments.
Discussions are on-going about integrating this work into the
`Wagtail Demo <https://github.com/torchbox/wagtaildemo/`.
